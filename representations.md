# Computationalism, computational theory of mind

- work with symbols. representations which can be manipulated
- to solve a problem, perform a series of steps involving representations

## Representation

- something that has meaning (semantic content)
- when the info is not directly present in the immediate env, then mental rep is needed
- internal representation -> steps of calculation -> reaches a state that enables the related behavior
- Neural code: some transduction of external signals and made into a format that can be communicated by neurons
  - decoded by downstream neurons.
  - problem: most neuro-studies measure the correllations between neural codes and the external world.

- In Marr's algorithmic level: need representations so that the algos can work on them  (algorithms are typically assumed to operate on representations or symbols)
  - Eg: LIP neurons in decision making.
- this approach is more about internal computation
- 3 key aspects:
  - correspondence (b/w rep and the thing it represents)
  - functional role (casual relation to behaviour)
  - teleological (purposive) context

### Weaknesses of a solely correspondence based approach to representations

(?)

### 2. Functional/causal role in behaviour

### 3. purpose/teleology

- place cells, time cells
