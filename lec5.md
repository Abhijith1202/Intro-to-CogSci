- PET scan (positron emission tomography): hemodynamically based, but can detect glucose intake.
  - Invasive as it uses radioactive tracing.
  - The tracers attach to glucose, and high glucose levels are found in regions of higher neuronal activity, so more tracers are found there.
  - Poor temporal resolution, good spatial resolution
- MEG: mag. encephalogram: Has high temporal and spatial resolution, but very expensive (need for mag. shielding).
  - The electrical activity in the brain generates a magnetic field and this magnetic field is measured by MEG. MEG fields pass through the head without any distortion by the conductive properties of the scalp/head and the MEG coil is not sensitive to perfectly radial sources.
  - MEG signal is tiny, it is susceptible to interference from external factors, such as the heartbeat, traffic, electrical equipment, etc. so it requires magnetically shielded rooms and supersensitive magnetometers.
- Place cells: cells in the hippocampus that encodes position in an environment. ( **neurons in the hippocampus that fire when an animal visits specific regions of its environment**, called place fields).
- Time cell: (read up) (are there preferential neurons that fire at specific time intervals, and neighboring neurons use this spark to recreate certain memory from the past)
  - neurons in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex that fire at specific moments within a cognitive task or experience.
- CNS: brain+spine, PNS: nerves
