- Oxygenated and deoxygenated blood cells have different mag. property: basis of mri and related scans.
- (pro: )FMRI is a good tool to check signals from hippocampus (FMRI has better spatial resolution).
- (con: )FMRI has low temporal resolution (6-8 s lag).
- PET scan (positron emission tomography): hemodynamically based, but can detect glucose intake.
- MEG: mag. encephalogram: Has high temporal and spatial resolution, but very expensive (need for mag. shielding).
- Place cells: cells in the hippocampus that encodes position in an environment. ( **neurons in the hippocampus that fire when an animal visits specific regions of its environment**, called place fields).
- Time cell: (read up) (are there preferential neurons that fire at specific time intervals, and neighboring neurons use this spark to recreate certain memory from the past)
- CNS: brain+spine, PNS: nerves
