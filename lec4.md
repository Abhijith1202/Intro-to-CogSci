## 2 Modes of research:

- Behavioral
  - Psychophysics etc.	
- Neural



## Psychophysics

Involves measurement of perceptions by individuals. 

## Weber's law

- d(I)/I = k
- Stronger the baseline stimulus, the bigger the change required to detect a difference
- eg: 2 small lines differing in length can be distinguished easily, while longer ones need a bigger difference to clearly distinguish.
- Not a real law, since we cant explain the phenomena using this law, its only a description about the observation/phenomenon.

## Signal detection theory

- Signal detection in a noisy environment depends on person's sensitivity to the stimulus _and_ their response to the signal.
