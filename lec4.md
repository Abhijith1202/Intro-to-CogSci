## 2 Types of research

- Theory driven
  - Theory-driven research is a more traditional approach of conducting scientific inquiry that starts with developing hypotheses, followed by collecting and analysing data to test these hypotheses and drawing theoretical conclusions based on the results.
- Exploratory
  - We collect data in some setting, then apply correlational analysis to understand a possible conclusion that the correlation formed could lead to, construct a hypothesis, test this new hypothesis and loop through until a solid theory is built. This gives us insight into new possible theories we couldn’t have come across otherwise.

## 2 Modes of research:

- Behavioral
  - Observational methods based on an organism’s response to stimulus
  - Psychophysics etc.	
  
- Neural
  - Analysing brain signals on performing certain actions or responding to stimuli
  - EEG, IMRI etc.


## Psychophysics

Involves measurement of perceptions by individuals. 

## Weber's law

- d(I)/I = k
- Stronger the baseline stimulus, the bigger the change required to detect a difference
- eg: 2 small lines differing in length can be distinguished easily, while longer ones need a bigger difference to clearly distinguish.
- Not a real law, since we cant explain the phenomena using this law, its only a description about the observation/phenomenon.

## Signal detection theory

- Signal detection in a noisy environment depends on person's sensitivity to the stimulus _and_ their response to the signal.
