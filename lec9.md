## Gestalt Principles of Organisation

- holistic/gestalt: whole is something else than the sum of its parts.
- Brain has a innate organising tendencies that allow us to perceive things as wholes than individual elements

## Gestalt principles of perceptual organisation

- Similarity
- Continuation
- Closure (perceive figures with gaps to be continuous)
- Figure-ground : Organisation depends on what we see as object and what we perceive as ground (context).



- Not limited to visual domain

- Gestalt laws are heuristics
  - can lead to incorrect perception or error.
- Modern perceptual psychology: perception is shaped by knowledge of regularities in the environment.



- (Topdown and bottom up)

## Models of recognition

### 1. Template matching

- match the whole image to a stored representation of the object
- problem: template typically doesn't account for all possible variations of the obj.

### 2. Feature matching

- Extract important or disc. features (eg edges, colours shape etc) from image and match with known features of obj

### 3. (?) recognition by components

- Problem: viewpoint invariance is possible (except for some accidental viewpoints).

### 4. configural model

- obj recognised acc to spatial relations among the shared parts and the extend to which they deviate
- damage to fisiform area leads to prosopagnosia
- Expertise hypothesise
  - specialised neural sustem develops for experts required to judge subtle differences within any particular category 



## Perceptual constancy



- Mirror neurons(?)
  - Moebius syndrome, cerebral palsy, brocal aphrasia: anomalies



## Types of perceptual learning

- Attentional weighting (increasing attention paid to important aspects and by decreasing the attention to irrelevant ones)
  - shifts may be strategic choices
  - categorical perception
- Differentiation 
  - perceive the difference between two properties, where they couldnt perceive the difference before
  - Stimuli that were once psychologically fused together become separated
- Unitization
  - Group things together as a group
  - opposite of differentiation
  - eg: perceive written words as a single unit
- Stimulus imprinting
