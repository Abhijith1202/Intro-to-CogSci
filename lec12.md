  - perceive the indiv parts, then make it a whole in the brain.
  - relies on the properties of the stimulus.
  - prior experience has no influence on this model of perception.
  - Marr's computational approach is based on bottom up processing
    - make primary sketch -> complete the primal sketch -> 
- Gibbsonian bottom up approach (???)
- (ABC 12 13 14 example) not based on perception, but some other cognitive process.
- chaz firestone paper (who dat???)
- judgement is top down (relevance?)
