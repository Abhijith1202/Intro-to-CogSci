Cornea -> pupil -> lens -> retina

### Sclera

-  white part

### Iris:

- Large coloured part

### Pupil

- Aperture

### Optic nerve

- Collection of axons of the retinal nerves

  

- The fovea centralis, or fovea, is **a small depression within the neurosensory retina where visual acuity is the highest** (lotta cone cells)



- Colour opponent representation
- McCullogh effect
- Peripheral vision
- Illusory conjunction (unsuccessful  binding of visual perceptions)
