## Context dependent learning

- superior retrieval when external context matches the context of original memories

- Encode in land, recall underwater -> poor recall; encode on land, recall on land -> good recall

- Language can also be a context.



- Memory retrieval could be beneficial as well as detrimental to other memories.
- Testing effect
- Spacing out the rehearsal is better (study gradually rather than studying it all just before the exam).
- Retrieval induced forgetting (?)



## Multiple forms of memory

## Memory failures (7 sins of memory)

1.  Transciance
   - forgetting what occurs with the passage of time
   - Decay: memory fades over time
   - Interference: memories compete with each other
   - Retroactive inhibition: new info blocks old info
   - Proactive (opp. retroactive)
2. Absentmindedness
   - a lapse in attention that results in memory failure
   - prospective memory (?)
3. Blocking
   - failure to retrieve info that is available in the memory (retrieval failure)
   - we know the answer but we cant access it
4. Memory misattribution
   - assigning a recollection or an idea to the wrong source
   - Source memory: recall of when, where and how info was acquired
     - eg. who was the person who first told about memory misattribution and where did this happen
   - Cryptomnesia: mistakenly forgot "our" ideas originated elsewhere
   - False recognition (deja vu)x
     - feeling of familiarity about something that hasn't been encountered before 
     - same brain activation as true recognition
5. idk
6. Bias
