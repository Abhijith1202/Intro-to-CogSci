# Multisensory Integration (Vinoo Alluri)

- Senses are almost never isolated (mix of different senses)

## Superior colliculus (SC)

- Integration centre of different senses
- Located in the Midbrain
- individual sc neurons can receive sensory info from more than one modality (convergence).
- e.g., visual inputs from the retina and auditory inputs from the inferior colliculus converge on the same SC neuron rendering it multisensory

## Olfactory Tubercule (OT)

- auditory+olfactory integration centre
- Congruent sound can increase the pleasant-ness rating of a smell (potato chip coffee exp)



## Orbitofrontal cortex

- receive inputs from primary olfactory cortex, gustatory cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, superior (auditory) and inferior temporal gyrus (visual) and emotion centers (amygdala)



## Synesthesia

- Exp in one sensory modality seems to induce an experience in another.
- can run in families
- (Associate songs with images)
- due to increased communication between sensory regions and is involuntary, automatic, and stable over time .
- adjacency principle:
  - result of the neural areas in which the information is processed being adjacent to one another or greater connectivity
